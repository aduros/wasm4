# Drawing the Snake

## Drawing the Body

<MultiLanguage>

<Page value="assemblyscript">

To draw the snake, you can take advantage of AssemblyScripts `forEach` function.
To make it a little easier, it's a good idea to use the `rect` function of WASM-4:

```typescript
// rect draws a rectangle. It uses color 1 to fill and color 2 for the outline
function rect(x: i32, y: i32, width: u32, height: u32): void;
```

With that out the way, let's see what a first draft could look like.

```typescript
draw(): void {
    this.body.forEach(part => w4.rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8))
}
```

Simply loop through the body and draw it at `x * 8` and `y * 8`. 8 is the width and the height of a single part. On a 160x160 screen, it's big enough to fit snake that is 20*20=400 parts long.

:::note Importing w4
Keep in mind you need to import `w4` in case your editor doesn't do this for you.
:::

That's all fine, but since there is no instance of the snake, nothing can be drawn. To fix this, simply create a new variable in main and call it's draw function:

```typescript {1,4,14}
import { Point, Snake } from "./snake"
import * as w4 from "./wasm4"

const snake = new Snake()

export function start(): void {
    store<u32>(w4.PALETTE, 0xfbf7f3, 0 * sizeof<u32>())
    store<u32>(w4.PALETTE, 0xe5b083, 1 * sizeof<u32>())
    store<u32>(w4.PALETTE, 0x426e5d, 2 * sizeof<u32>())
    store<u32>(w4.PALETTE, 0x20283d, 3 * sizeof<u32>())
}

export function update(): void {
    snake.draw()
}
```

After that, simply call the `draw` function of the snake.

To draw the snake, we will use a for loop to iterate over the body.
To make it a little easier, it's a good idea to use the `rect` function of WASM-4:

```c
// rect draws a rectangle. It uses color 1 to fill and color 2 for the outline
void rect (int32_t x, int32_t y, uint32_t width, uint32_t height);
```

With that out the way, let's see what a first draft could look like. Add the following code to `snake.c` and a corresponding declaration to `snake.h`.

```c
void snake_draw(struct snake *snake)
{
    *DRAW_COLORS = 0x0043;
    for(size_t i = 0; i < snake->length; ++i)
    {
        rect(snake->body[i].x*8, snake->body[i].y*8,8,8);  
    }
}
```

Simply loop through the body and draw it at `x*8` and `y*8`. 8 is the width and the height of a single part. On a 160x160 screen, it's big enough to fit snake that is 20*20=400 parts long.

That's all fine, but since there is no instance of the snake, nothing can be drawn. To fix this, simply create a new variable in main and call its draw function:

```c {5,14-19,24}
#include "wasm4.h"
#include "snake.h"
#include <stdlib.h>

struct snake snake;

void start() 
{
    PALETTE[0] = 0xfbf7f3;
    PALETTE[1] = 0xe5b083;
    PALETTE[2] = 0x426e5d;
    PALETTE[3] = 0x20283d;

    snake_create(&snake);
    snake_push(&snake,(struct point){2,0});
    snake_push(&snake,(struct point){1,0});
    snake_push(&snake,(struct point){0,0});
   
    snake.direction = (struct point){1,0};
}

void update () 
{
  snake_draw(&snake);
}
```

We'll add a new function `draw` inside `Snake` implementation.

To make it a little easier, it's a good idea to use the `rect` function of WASM-4 
that is already defined in `src/lib/wasm4.rs`:

```rust
// rect draws a rectangle. It uses color 1 to fill and color 2 for the outline
pub fn rect(x: i32, y: i32, width: u32, height: u32);
```

Simply loop through the body and draw it at `x * 8` and `y * 8` because our snake is made of 8x8 squares.

```rust
// src/snake.rs inside `impl Snake {}` block
pub fn draw(&self) {
    for &Point { x, y } in self.body.iter() {
        wasm4::rect(x * 8, y * 8, 8, 8);
    }
}
```

:::note Importing wasm4
Keep in mind you need to import `wasm4`, in case your editor doesn't do this for you.

```rust
use crate::wasm4;
```
:::

---

That's all fine, but since there is no instance of the snake, nothing can be drawn. To fix this we are going to define a `Game` struct
inside `src/game.rs`.

```rust
// src/game.rs
use crate::snake::{Point, Snake};
use crate::wasm4;

pub struct Game {
    snake: Snake,
}

impl Game {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
      Self {
          snake: Snake::new(),
      }
    }

    pub fn update(&self) {
        self.snake.draw();
    }
}
```

We'll store a global `Game` instance using [`Mutex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html), provided by the standard library, and the macro [`lazy_static`](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static) from [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

```rust
// src/lib.rs
mod game;
mod palette;
mod snake;
mod wasm4;
use game::Game;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use std::sync::Mutex;

lazy_static! {
    static ref SNAKE_GAME: Mutex<Game> = Mutex::new(Game::new());
}

#[no_mangle]
fn start() {
    palette::set_palette([0xfff6d3, 0xf9a875, 0xeb6b6f, 0x7c3f58]);
}

#[no_mangle]
fn update() {
    SNAKE_GAME.lock().expect("game_state").update();
}
```

:::note Using external libraries
[`lazy_static`](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static) is an external library:

we have to declare inside the `dependencies` section of `Cargo.toml`, otherwise `rustc` does not know how to resolve it and will
not compile our game.

```toml {3}

lazy_static = "1.4.0"

To draw the snake, you can loop through each point using the `loop` instruction. To make it a little easier, it's a good idea to use the `Rect` function of WASM-4:

```wasm
;; Rect draws a rectangle. It uses color 1 to fill and color 2 for the outline
(import "env" "rect" (func $rect (param i32 i32 i32 i32)))
```

With that out the way, let's see what a first draft could look like. In the WebAssembly text format, it's often simpler to use an address directly rather than an array index. However, since we know that the array starts at 0x19ac, we can use that as a direct index in the load instructions. So we'll actually use a byte offset to access each point of the snake.

```wasm
(func $snake-draw
  (local $offset i32)      ;; offset is initialized to 0
  (local $offset-end i32)

  ;; offset-end = body_length * 8
  (local.set $offset-end
    (i32.mul
      (i32.load (i32.const 0x19a8))  ;; body_length
      (i32.const 8)))

  ;; loop over all points in the body
  (loop $loop
    ;; rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8)
    ;; 
    ;; Note that the array starts at 0x19ac, so the first x-coordinate starts
    ;; at 0x19ac and the first y-coordinate starts at 0x19b0. We can bake these
    ;; offsets directly into the instruction to reduce the code size.
    (call $rect
      (i32.mul (i32.load offset=0x19ac (local.get $offset)) (i32.const 8))
      (i32.mul (i32.load offset=0x19b0 (local.get $offset)) (i32.const 8))
      (i32.const 8)
      (i32.const 8))

    ;; Add 8 to offset, and loop if offset < offset-end.
    (br_if $loop
      (i32.lt_u
        (local.tee $offset (i32.add (local.get $offset) (i32.const 8)))
        (local.get $offset-end)))
  )
)
```

Simply loop through the body and draw it at `x * 8` and `y * 8`. 8 is the width and the height of a single part. On a 160x160 screen, it's big enough to fit snake that is 20*20=400 parts long.

That's all fine, but nothing will be drawn until we call this function from `update`:

```wasm
(func (export "update")
  (call $snake-draw)
)
```

To draw the snake, you can take advantage of zig's `for` syntax.
To make it a little easier, it's a good idea to use the `rect` function of WASM-4:

// rect draws a rectangle. It uses color 1 to fill and color 2 for the outline
fn rect(x: i32, y: i32, width: u32, height: u32) void;
```

```zig {2,9-13}
// Add this to the top of the file
const w4 = @import("wasm4.zig");

// ...

pub const Snake = struct {
    // ...

    pub fn draw(this: *@This()) void {
        for(this.body.constSlice()) |part| {
            w4.rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8);
        }
    }
}
```

Simply loop through the body and draw it at `x * 8` and `y * 8`. 8 is the width and the height of a single part. On a 160x160 screen, it's big enough to fit snake that is 20*20=400 parts long. This is where the 400 in the BoundedArray declaration comes from: we cap the number of elements to 400 at comptime so we don't have to deal with dynamically allocating memory for the points.

That's all fine, but since we haven't initialized the snake, nothing can be drawn. To fix this, simply create a new variable in main and call its draw function:

```zig {2,4,16}
const w4 = @import("wasm4.zig");
const Snake = @import("snake.zig").Snake;

var snake = Snake.init();

export fn start() void {
    w4.PALETTE.* = .{
        0xfbf7f3,
        0xe5b083,
        0x426e5d,
        0x20283d,
    };
}

export fn update() void {
    snake.draw();
}
```

## Drawing the Head

<MultiLanguage>

<Page value="assemblyscript">

But where is the head? You can pick a side. Either position `[0]` or position `[this.body.length - 1]`.

I think it's easier to pick `[0]`.

Since the body is drawn, head is not much of a problem. Simply use the `rect` function again. But use a specific part instead:

```typescript
    w4.rect(this.body[0].x * 8, this.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8)
```

The draw function should now look like this:

```typescript {3}
draw(): void {
    this.body.forEach(part => w4.rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8))
    w4.rect(this.body[0].x * 8, this.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8)
}
```

Notice the difference? Me neither.

The head should stand out a little. For this, you can use a different color:

```typescript
store<u16>(w4.DRAW_COLORS, 0x0004)
```

You can set the colors with this variable. You can look at this variable like a table that is read from right to left.

The value for each digit can be  0 up to 4:

- 0 = Use transparency
- 1 = Use the 1st color from the color palette
- 2 = Use the 2nd color from the color palette
- 3 = Use the 3rd color from the color palette
- 4 = Use the 4th color from the color palette

The snippet above reads like this: "Color 1 uses Color 4 of the color palette, Color 2 to Color 4 don't use any color." The basic drawing functions use "Color 1" to fill the shape and "Color 2" for the border.

If you change the source to

```typescript {4}
draw(): void {
    this.body.forEach(part => w4.rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8))

    store<u16>(w4.DRAW_COLORS, 0x0004)
    w4.rect(this.body[0].x * 8, this.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8)
}
```

Result:

![Changing Color](images/draw-body-2.webp)

You'll see a change. The snake changed color. Not only the head, but the complete snake! Once you've set a color, it stays that way. So if you want to change only the head, you have to change Color 1 again. Right before you draw the body.

```typescript {2}
draw(): void {
    store<u16>(w4.DRAW_COLORS, 0x0043)
    this.body.forEach(part => w4.rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8))

    store<u16>(w4.DRAW_COLORS, 0x0004)
    w4.rect(this.body[0].x * 8, this.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8)
}
```

This changes the color back and adds the darker green as its outline.

- 1 = Use the 1st color from the color palette
- 2 = Use the 2nd color from the color palette
- 3 = Use the 3rd color from the color palette
- 4 = Use the 4th color from the color palette

The snippet above reads like this: "Color 1 uses Color 4 of the color palette, Color 2 to Color 4 don't use any color." The basic drawing functions use "Color 1" to fill the shape and "Color 2" for the border.

If you change the source to

```lua {7}
function Snake:draw()
  for i = 1, #self.body do
    rect(self.body[i].x * 8, self.body[i].y * 8, 8, 8)
  end

  $DRAW_COLORS = 0x0004;
  rect(self.body[1].x * 8, self.body[1].y * 8, 8, 8)
end
```

Result:

![Changing Color](images/draw-body-2.webp)

You'll see a change. The snake changed color. Not only the head, but the complete snake! Once you've set a color, it stays that way. So if you want to change only the head, you have to change Color 1 again. Right before you draw the body.

```lua {2}
function Snake:draw()
  $DRAW_COLORS = 0x0043;
  for i = 1, #self.body do
    rect(self.body[i].x * 8, self.body[i].y * 8, 8, 8)
  end

  $DRAW_COLORS = 0x0004;
  rect(self.body[1].x * 8, self.body[1].y * 8, 8, 8)
end
```

This changes the color back and adds the darker green as its outline.

But where is the head? You can pick a side. Either position `0` or position `self.body.len() - 1`.
I think it's easier to pick `0`.

Since the body is drawn, head is not much of a problem. Simply use the `rect` function again. But use a specific part instead:

```rust {7}
// src/snake.r` inside `impl Snake {}` block
pub fn draw(&self) {
    for &Point { x, y } in self.body.iter() {
        wasm4::rect(x * 8, y * 8, 8, 8);
    }

    wasm4::rect(self.body[0].x * 8, self.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8);
}
```

Notice the difference? Me neither.
The head should stand out a little. For this, you can use a different color.

We'll create a helper function inside `src/palette.rs` to confine the `unsafe` code.

```rust
// src/palette.rs
pub fn set_draw_color(idx: u16) {
    unsafe { *wasm4::DRAW_COLORS = idx.into() }
}
```

Then we'll invoke `draw_color` inside `src/snake.rs`:

```rust {2,10}
// src/snake.rs
use crate::palette::set_draw_color;

// Inside inside `impl Snake {}` block
pub fn draw(&self) {
    for &Point { x, y } in self.body.iter() {
        wasm4::rect(x * 8, y * 8, 8, 8);
    }

    set_draw_color(0x4);
    wasm4::rect(self.body[0].x * 8, self.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8);
}
```

Result:

use crate::palette::set_draw_color;

    for &Point { x, y } in self.body.iter() {
        wasm4::rect(x * 8, y * 8, 8, 8);
    }

    set_draw_color(0x4);
    wasm4::rect(self.body[0].x * 8, self.body[0].y * 8, 8, 8);
}
```

But where is the head? You can pick a side. Either position `[0]` or position `[body_length - 1]`.

I think it's easier to pick `[0]`.

Since the body is drawn, head is not much of a problem. Simply use the `rect` function again. But use a specific part instead:

```wasm
(call $rect
  (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19ac)) (i32.const 8))
  (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19b0)) (i32.const 8))
  (i32.const 8)
  (i32.const 8))
```

The draw function should now look like this:

```wasm
(func $snake-draw
  (local $offset i32)      ;; offset is initialized to 0
  (local $offset-end i32)

  ;; offset-end = body_length * 8
  (local.set $offset-end
    (i32.mul
      (i32.load (i32.const 0x19a8))  ;; body_length
      (i32.const 8)))

  ;; loop over all points in the body
  (loop $loop
    ;; rect(part.x * 8, part.y * 8, 8, 8)
    ;; 
    ;; Note that the array starts at 0x19a4, so the first x-coordinate starts
    ;; at 0x19a4 and the first y-coordinate starts at 0x19a8. We can bake these
    ;; offsets directly into the instruction to reduce the code size.
    (call $rect
      (i32.mul (i32.load offset=0x19ac (local.get $offset)) (i32.const 8))
      (i32.mul (i32.load offset=0x19b0 (local.get $offset)) (i32.const 8))
      (i32.const 8)
      (i32.const 8))

    ;; Add 8 to offset, and loop if offset < offset-end.
    (br_if $loop
      (i32.lt_u
        (local.tee $offset (i32.add (local.get $offset) (i32.const 8)))
        (local.get $offset-end)))
  )

  ;; Draw the head.
  (call $rect
    (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19ac)) (i32.const 8))
    (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19b0)) (i32.const 8))
    (i32.const 8)
    (i32.const 8))
)
```

Notice the difference? Me neither.

The head should stand out a little. For this, you can use a different color:

```wasm
  (i32.store16 (global.get $DRAW_COLORS) (i32.const 0x0004))
```

You can set the colors with this variable. You can look at this variable like a table that is read from right to left.

The value for each digit can be  0 up to 4:

- 0 = Use transparency
- 1 = Use the 1st color from the color palette
- 2 = Use the 2nd color from the color palette
- 3 = Use the 3rd color from the color palette
- 4 = Use the 4th color from the color palette

The snippet above reads like this: "Color 1 uses Color 4 of the color palette, Color 2 to Color 4 don't use any color." The basic drawing functions use "Color 1" to fill the shape and "Color 2" for the border.

If you change the source to

```wasm
(func $snake-draw
  ...

  ;; Set the head color.
  (i32.store16 (global.get $DRAW_COLORS) (i32.const 0x0004))

  ;; Draw the head.
  (call $rect
    (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19ac)) (i32.const 8))
    (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19b0)) (i32.const 8))
    (i32.const 8)
    (i32.const 8))
)
```

  ;; Set the head color.
  (i32.store16 (global.get $DRAW_COLORS) (i32.const 0x0004))

  ;; Draw the head.
  (call $rect
    (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19ac)) (i32.const 8))
    (i32.mul (i32.load (i32.const 0x19b0)) (i32.const 8))
    (i32.const 8)
    (i32.const 8))
)
```

This changes the color back and adds the darker green as it's outline.

But where is the head? You can pick a side. Either position `[0]` or position `[this.body.length - 1]`.

I think it's easier to pick `[0]`.

Since the body is drawn, head is not much of a problem. Simply use the `rect` function again. But use a specific part instead:
