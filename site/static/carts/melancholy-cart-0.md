# Melancholy: cart 0

A top grade `[E X P E R I E N C E]`, right there on your WASM-4 device!

Explore the environment, fight your enemies (singular), look for secrets (plural) and most importantly: go outside (scary).

This `[E X P E R I E N C E]` is a part of the [Melancholy](https://github.com/De-Alchmst/melancholy.git) 'surrealist programming' project.
