# Publish Your Game

## Create a Publish Version

You need a version of your game that you can publish. You'll also need a cover-image.

While your game runs in the browser, press `F9` on your keyboard. This will generate a screenshot in PNG format. You can use this as a cover-image.

Now let's compile your game.

<MultiLanguage>

<Page value="assemblyscript">

```shell
npm run build
```

Your game will be here: `build/cart.wasm`

</Page>

<Page value="c">

```shell
make
```

Your game will be here: `build/cart.wasm`

</Page>

<Page value="d">

// TODO

</Page>

<Page value="go">

```shell
make
```

Your game will be here: `build/cart.wasm`

</Page>

<Page value="nelua">

```shell
make
```

Your game will be here: `build/cart.wasm`

</Page>

<Page value="nim">

// TODO

</Page>

<Page value="odin">

</Page>

<Page value="porth">

</Page>

<Page value="rust">

```shell
cargo build --release
```

Your game will be here: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cart.wasm`

If you have downloaded [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) now it's the time to run [`wasm-opt`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen#wasm-opt):

```bash
# run with `--help` for more details about this command
wasm-opt target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cart.wasm -o snake-cart-opt.wasm -Oz --strip-dwarf --strip-producers --zero-filled-memory
```

`wasm-opt` has created a new file `./snake-cart-opt.wasm` that is likely far smaller than `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cart.wasm`.

:::note Other tools

If you're still having trouble with the cart size I suggest you to profile it using [`twiggy`](https://github.com/rustwasm/twiggy) and
 then remove unused functions with [`wasm-snip`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-snip):

*wasm-snip replaces a WebAssembly function's body with an unreachable instruction.
This is a rather heavy, blunt hammer for functions that kind of look like nails if you squint hard enough.*

<Page value="zig">

```shell
zig build -Drelease-small=true
```

Your game will be here: `zig-out/lib/cart.wasm`

</MultiLanguage>

## Your Account

:::note Early version
The WASM-4 project is still in it's early stages. The process of submitting your game onto the website is still not finished and a little rough around the edges.
:::

WASM-4 and its website are stored in a Git-Repo (short for Repository) hosted on GitHub.

To publish your game, you *need* a GitHub Account. If you don't have one already, [create one](https://github.com/join). In case you already have one, [login](https://github.com/login).

## Forking the Repo

Now you need to "fork" the repo. For this, go to the [original GitHub Repo of WASM-4](https://github.com/aduros/wasm4).

At the top you will find some "actions" you can take: `Watch/Unwatch`, `Star/Unstar`, `Fork`. The last one is what you're looking for.

## Uploading Your Game

Follow the [Distribution](https://wasm4.org/docs/guides/distribution#publish-on-wasm4org) instructions from the earlier Guides section.

## Letting WASM-4 Know

Your fork is now ready. Switch to the `Pull Requests` tab and press on "New pull request".

![Pull Request](images/pull-request.png)

Add some comment if you want. And then press "Make pull request" at the bottom. You're done!

## Wait a Bit

Since this procedure is currently involving the interaction of humans, your PR (short for Pull Request) needs to be verified by a maintainer. Your PR will also cause a notification in our Discord channel to let us know sooner rather than later.

And once a maintainer approves your PR, another notification will be sent to our Discord channel.

## Discord!

If you have questions or if you don't want to miss when your game is added (or simply want to talk to a bunch of nice people), [join us on our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7teRdHdbYk).
