# IWAS

A sound tool for WASM-4.

**[Check out it's page on itch.io!](https://mrrafael.itch.io/iwas)**

## Quick overview

This is a very simple sound tool designed around the limitations of this fantasy console. There aren't many sound tools available for it, so I thought about making one.

Due to the 1KB save game limitations of this fantasy console, it can only store one song. However, you can save/load other songs by pressing **Enter** to open the main menu, then selecting *Disk Options* to import/export the save file.
Controls

**Everything in the editor can be used with a mouse.** Just click and play around!

## About

Developed entirely by me, using the **[AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)** programming language. It took me a few weeks to make it, but I really liked the way it is now.

Play around with it, and have fun! :D
