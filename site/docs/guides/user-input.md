# User Input

## Gamepad

The main input device is the gamepad, consisting of 4 directions and 2 action
buttons. On computers, players use the arrow keys and the X and Z keys. On
mobile, a virtual gamepad overlay is displayed that players can tap.

The gamepad state is stored by WASM-4 as one byte in memory, with each button
stored as a single bit. For example, the right directional button is stored in
bit 5. We can mask the gamepad with the `BUTTON_RIGHT` constant to check if the
right button is pressed.

<MultiLanguageCode>

```typescript
const gamepad = load<u8>(w4.GAMEPAD1);

if (gamepad & w4.BUTTON_RIGHT) {
    w4.trace("Right button is down!");
}
```

```c
uint8_t gamepad = *GAMEPAD1;

if (gamepad & BUTTON_RIGHT) {
    trace("Right button is down!");
}
```

```d
ubyte gamepad = *w4.gamepad1;

if (gamepad & w4.buttonRight) {
    w4.trace("Right button is down!");
}
```

```go
var gamepad = *w4.GAMEPAD1

if gamepad&w4.BUTTON_RIGHT != 0 {
    w4.Trace("Right button is down!")
}
```

```lua
local gamepad = $GAMEPAD1

if gamepad & BUTTON_RIGHT ~= 0 then
    trace("Right button is down!")
end
```

```nim
var gamepad = GAMEPAD1[]

if bool(gamepad and BUTTON_RIGHT):
  trace("Right button is down!")
```

```odin
if .RIGHT in w4.GAMEPAD1^ {
    w4.trace("Right button is down!")
}
```

```rust
let gamepad = unsafe { *GAMEPAD1 };

if gamepad & BUTTON_RIGHT != 0 {
    trace("Right button is down!");
}
```

```wasm
(data (i32.const 0x2000) "Right button is down!\00")

(local $gamepad i32)
(local.set $gamepad (i32.load8_u (global.get $GAMEPAD1)))

(if (i32.and (local.get $gamepad) (global.get $BUTTON_RIGHT))
  (then
    (call $trace (i32.const 0x2000))
  )
)
```

```zig

if (gamepad.button_right) {
    w4.trace("Right button is down!");

### Checking if a button was pressed this frame

`GAMEPAD1` stores the current state of the gamepad. It's common to want to know
if a button was just pressed this frame. Another way of putting it: if a
button was *not* down last frame but *is* down this frame.

This can be handled by storing the previous gamepad state, and then [bitwise
XORing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR) (`^`)
it with the current gamepad state. This leaves us with a byte with only the
buttons that were pressed this frame.

<MultiLanguageCode>

```typescript
let previousGamepad: u8;

export function update () {
    const gamepad = load<u8>(w4.GAMEPAD1);

    // Only the buttons that were pressed down this frame
    const pressedThisFrame = gamepad & (gamepad ^ previousGamepad);
    previousGamepad = gamepad;

    if (pressedThisFrame & w4.BUTTON_RIGHT) {
        trace("Right button was just pressed!");
    }
}
```

```c
uint8_t previousGamepad;

void update () {
    uint8_t gamepad = *GAMEPAD1;

    // Only the buttons that were pressed down this frame
    uint8_t pressedThisFrame = gamepad & (gamepad ^ previousGamepad);
    previousGamepad = gamepad;

    if (pressedThisFrame & BUTTON_RIGHT) {
        trace("Right button was just pressed!");
    }
}
```

```d
ubyte previousGamepad;

void update() {
    ubyte gamepad = *w4.gamepad1;

    // Only the buttons that were pressed down this frame
    ubyte pressedThisFrame = gamepad & (gamepad ^ previousGamepad);
    previousGamepad = gamepad;

    if (pressedThisFrame & w4.buttonRight) {
        w4.trace("Right button was just pressed!");
    }
}
```

```go
var previousGamepad byte

//go:export update
func update () {
    var gamepad = *w4.GAMEPAD1

    // Only the buttons that were pressed down this frame
    var pressedThisFrame = gamepad & (gamepad ^ previousGamepad)
    previousGamepad = gamepad

    if pressedThisFrame&w4.BUTTON_RIGHT != 0 {
        w4.Trace("Right button was just pressed!")
    }
}
```

    previous_gamepad = gamepad

    if pressed_this_frame & BUTTON_RIGHT ~= 0 then
        trace("Right button was just pressed!")
