# Pega-Pega: the game

This game is all about following each other around and firing!!!
Once you have your opponent on your sight, FIRE!
You can either play with one keyboard or using NetPlay WASM-4 support.

## Single keyboard

- Player 1: arrow keys to move - shoots with button X;
- Player 2: buttons S, F, E, and D to move - shoots with button A;

## NetPlaying

- Both players use the arrow keys on their own keyboards to move and shoot with button X.
